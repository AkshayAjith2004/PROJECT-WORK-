<p>The Pyramid of Giza refers to the largest of three ancient Egyptian pyramids built for pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure around 4,500 years ago. The Great Pyramid of Giza, built for Khufu, was the first and largest, and served as his tomb. Originally standing about 147 meters (481 feet) tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world for nearly 4,000 years, though it has since been reduced to 138.8 meters (455.4 feet) due to erosion and the removal of its outer casing stones.</p>

<p>The Taj Mahal  'Crown of the Palace') is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658), to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. </p>
